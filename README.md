# stock-analysis

Purpose of Analysis

The Purpose of the analysis was to provide Steve with an easier workbook to read the stocks from 2017 and 2018.  Steve along with the help of his parents will use the information to decide whether stocks are profitable or not.  My goal was to refactor the VBA code data and make it faster and easier for Steve to read. 


Results of Analysis 

The results of the stock analysis will show that 2017 was a better performance year than 2018.  In 2017 all but one company had a positive return on daily volume.  In 2018 only 2 companies of the 12 companies saw a positive return on daily volume.  The execution times were faster when the 2018 code was run vs the 2017.  There were also more returns over 100% in 2017 compared to 2018.  

Summary

An advantage of refactoring code is that you can work faster and more efficient.  You can use patterns easier in refactoring code.  Instead of going through each cell or chart individually you can program what ever repeating code you need.  You can also create message boxes to remind you of things or make it easier for people who are less familiar with excel.  Some disadvantages are not knowing the proper code you may need or a code that hasnâ€™t been invented yet that you are able to look up.   These advantages apply to refactoring the original VBA script because we were able to make it faster lo look up information and more efficient.
